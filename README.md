# Water-Quality-Classification
           The goal is to create a model that can accurately classify the drinkability of water based on various attributes such as pH levels, dissolved solids, and heavy metal concentrations.  This model will be a valuable tool for communities and organizations that need to ensure the safety of their drinking water.
